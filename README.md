MostUsed is a simple plugin for Obsidian that takes the 100 most common words from all the notes in your vault and shows them to you in a graph view.

You can either click on the icon seen in the video above or type the command "Show Most Used Words Graph" to show the graph. 

You can also exclude words or specify the scope of the scanning in the plugins settings.

The settings tab also includes an option to see the full list of all words present in your vault and gives the option to copy or export this list as a .txt or .json. Do note that you first have to use the graph feature before you can see the full list.
